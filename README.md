# Useful Snippets



## About

This R package contains only one function `add_snippets()`. This function will modify you r.snippet file for custom code snippets, or add such a file if you don't have one. It will add useful snippets which I myself use a lot. 



## Installation

Install the package from GitHub with the following code:





```R
devtools::install_github("jpiversen/UsefulSnippets")
```



After installing the package, run: 



```R
UsefulSnippets::add_snippets()
```



Now the snippets should be installed at your computer.

## Contributing

If you have useful code snippets you use often you are welcome to add them to the package and submit them in a PR with me on review.
